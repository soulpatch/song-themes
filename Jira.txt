            is manual testing of UI enough?
            Push UI "logic" into Java code
            UI templates exclusively about presentation (i.e. should not have logic)

            If doing end-to-end testing, could use HTMLUnit

            HTMX - provides interactivity with less complexity

            InfiTest - tests run every time code is compiled (TO-DO give a try sometime)

[X] Package up according to Hexagonal Architecture
