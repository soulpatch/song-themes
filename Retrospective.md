# 2024 June 19th

* Learned can pin an IntelliJ editor tab
* Doing more spikes with HTMX before test driving would reduce wasted effort
* Learned about %1$s (not zero based) but only for .formatted()
* Learned about the empty button text because of hx-post swap -- because we didn't have hx-swap="none"
* Learned that stuck meta key from remote user prevented scrolling and other UI issue
* Discovered that autocomplete post was inside the form, so was submitting the other elements
* Fewer commits today because more experiments/spikes
